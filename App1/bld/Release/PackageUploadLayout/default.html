                    The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organisation established on 24 October 1945 to promote international cooperation. It replaced the League of Nations and the organisation was created following World War II to prevent another conflict. At the time it was founded, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. Most nations are members of the UN and send people to the headquarters to hold meetings and pass resolutions (make decisions) about global issues.

                    The goals of the United Nations are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>to keep world peace</li>
                        <li>to help countries get along</li>
                        <li>to improve living conditions for people all over the world</li>
                        <li>and to make the world a better place</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>After World War I, the nations of the world formed the League of Nations. This organization was a place where nations could talk through their differences calmly. However, some countries like Germany, Italy and Japan ignored the League and tried to solve their problems through war. Because members of the League of Nations did not want to go to war to protect other members, the League failed and the Second World War began.

                    During World War II, the Allied Powers often called themselves "the United Nations" (united against the Axis Powers). After the War, the winners formed a new organization for world peace. On 25th April 1945 in San Francisco, they decided on the name 'United Nations'. The U.N. was created on 24th October 1945 and its first meeting was held in January 1946. Since 1947 the 24th of October has been called 'United Nations Day'.
                <br/>
                <h4>Headquarters</h4>
                <p>All organs of UN are based in New york,USA,except the International Court of Justice which is located at The Hague in Netherlands
                </p>
                <h4>Activity</h4>
                <p>
                    The main building for the United Nations is in New York City in the United States of America, but the U.N. also has important offices in Geneva (Switzerland), Nairobi (Kenya) and Vienna (Austria). The U.N. tries to be peaceful, but sometimes when talks do not work the U.N., unlike the League of Nations, will fight too. In the 1950s the UN helped South Korea in a war against North Korea, and in the 1990's the U.N. helped to force Iraqi soldiers out of Kuwait. At other times, the U.N. has formed 'peacekeeping' forces. UN peacekeepers travel to troubled places in the world and try - sometimes successfully, sometimes not - to keep the peace. Today there are U.N. peacekeepers working in Afghanistan, Cyprus, Haiti, Liberia and several other countries. Through a series of goals, resolutions and declarations adopted by member nations of the United Nations, the world has a set of commitments, actions and goals to stop and reverse the spread of H.I.V. and scale up towards universal access to H.I.V. prevention, treatment, care and support services.
                </p>
                <h4>Divisions</h4>
                <p>
                    The United Nations has set up six "principal organs":<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>UN General Assembly</li>
                        <li>UN Secretariat</li>
                        <li>International Court of Justice</li>
                        <li>U.N. Security Council</li>
                        <li>U.N. Economic and Social Council</li>
                        <li>U.N. Trusteeship Council</li>
                    </ul>
                    Additionally there are some so-called "special agencies of the United Nations" (this is only a selection):<br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The United Nations Children's Fund (U.N.I.C.E.F.)</li>
                        <li>The World Health Organization (W.H.O.)</li>
                        <li>The Food and Agriculture Organization (F.A.O.)</li>
                        <li>The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (U.N.E.S.C.O.)</li>
                        <li>The International Labour Organization (I.L.O.)</li>
                        <li>The International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.)</li>
                        <li>The United Nations Environment Programme (U.N.E.P.)</li>
                        <li>The United Nations Development Programme (U.N.D.P.)</li>

                        Like real UN bodies, Model UN committees have lengthy agendas and many delegates who want to convey their country's positions. To help maintain order, Model UN conferences adopt rules of procedure to establish when a delegate may speak and what he or she may address. Some conferences adopt a few simple rules, while others use lengthy and complex rules of procedure. Because each conference is independent – there is no governing body for Model UN – rules of procedure vary. A few conferences adapt their rules of procedure directly from the United Nations rules while most use variations of the Roberts Rules of Order. It is essential to familiarize yourself with the rules of each specific conference you plan to attend.
                        <br />
                        At a Model UN conference, there is formal debate as well as informal debate, called caucusing.
                        <br /><br/>
                        <b>Formal Debate:</b><br/> During formal debate, the staff maintains a speakers list and delegates speak in the order they are listed. At this time, delegates have an opportunity to share their views with the entire committee. Delegates make speeches, answer questions, and introduce and debate resolutions and amendments. Formal debate is important to the committee\'s work. By not knowing the rules of procedure, delegates slow down the debate and hold back their committee\'s progress.
                        <br/><br/>
                         <b>Moderated Caucus:</b><br/> During a caucus, which is a temporary recess, the rules of procedure are suspended. To go to a moderated caucus, a delegate makes a motion to suspend debate and the committee votes. Caucusing helps to facilitate discussion, especially when there is a long speakers list. A moderated caucus is a mixture of both formal and informal debate. Anyone may speak if they raise their placard and are called on by the Chair.
                        <br />
                        .Unmoderated Caucus: In an unmoderated caucus, delegates meet informally with one another and the committee staff to discuss and negotiate draft resolutions, amendments and other issues.

                        The Charter of the United Nations was signed on 26 June 1945, in San Francisco, at the conclusion of the United Nations Conference on International Organisation, and came into force on 24 October 1945. The Statute of the International Court of Justice is an integral part of the Charter.
                        <br/>
                        Amendments to Articles 23, 27 and 61 of the Charter were adopted by the General Assembly on 17 December 1963 and came into force on 31 August 1965. A further amendment to Article 61 was adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 1971, and came into force on 24 September 1973. An amendment to Article 109, adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 1965, came into force on 12 June 1968.
                        <br/>
                        The amended Article 27 provides that decisions of the Security Council on procedural matters shall be made by an affirmative vote of nine members (formerly seven) and on all other matters by an affirmative vote of nine members (formerly seven), including the concurring votes of the five permanent members of the Security Council.
                        <br/>
                        The amendment to Article 61, which entered into force on 31 August 1965, enlarged the membership of the Economic and Social Council from eighteen to twenty-seven. The subsequent amendment to that Article, which entered into force on 24 September 1973, further increased the membership of the Council from twenty-seven to fifty-four.
                        <br/>
                        The amendment to Article 109, which relates to the first paragraph of that Article, provides that a General Conference of Member States for the purpose of reviewing the Charter may be held at a date and place to be fixed by a two-thirds vote of the members of the General Assembly and by a vote of any nine members (formerly seven) of the Security Council. Paragraph 3 of Article 109, which deals with the consideration of a possible review conference during the tenth regular session of the General Assembly, has been retained in its original form in its reference to a “vote, of any seven members of the Security Council”, the paragraph having been acted upon in 1955 by the General Assembly, at its tenth regular session, and by the Security Council.

                    Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law,<br />
                
                    Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations,<br />
                
                    Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,<br />
                
                    Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,<br />
                
                    Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,<br /><br />
                
                    Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.<br /><br />

                     aspiration of modern youth, especially through the continued expansion and enhancement of the 
                     organization through national and international collaborations.
